```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Step 1 - Load in tidyverse and read in data

library(tidyverse)
salmon <- read_csv("salmon_imports.csv")


```

```{r}
#Step 2 - Make an exploratory scatterplot 

salmon_plot <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point()

salmon_plot

## Overall, the exploratory scatterplot suggests that the relationship between year and salmon imports is linear. I have some hesitation due to the kinks in the line in 2004-2005 and 2013-2014. 

```

```{r}

#Step 3 - Linear Regression in R

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

#Write out model equation based on findings: 
# Based on y = β0 + β1x + (error term)


#Imports(tons) = -14982940 + 7550(Year)
#Slope means rate at which salmon imports increase per year 
#Y-intercept implies that there will be negative salmon caught in year "0" - this is nonscensical and implies that the model should NOT be used to extrapolate past values 


```

```{r}
#Step 4 - Model diagnostics 


par(mfrow = c(2,2)) #to view all four disgnostic plots at once
plot(salmon_model) #to view model diagnostics

#Do residuals appear normally distributed? 
#Yes, the residuals appear normally distributed 

#Any concerns about heteroscedasticity or outliers? 
#No, the spread of the residuals about the models remains relatively even over 'x'. (Where do I look for outliers?)


```
